# Comprehensive Singleton Pattern and Reference Handling Fix

## Improvements Made

### MasterShipGenerator.cs

1. **Improved Singleton Implementation**:
   - Enhanced `Instance` property getter with null checks and automatic instance finding
   - Added proper OnDestroy cleanup to clear the singleton reference
   - Added instance tracking in DebugMonitor for better diagnostics

2. **Improved Null Reference Handling**:
   - Added try-catch blocks to critical methods
   - Added detailed error logging with stack traces
   - Implemented proper error recovery mechanisms

3. **Fixed ProcessDecisionWithEncounter**:
   - Added comprehensive null checking
   - Improved error handling with detailed diagnostics
   - Added safety measures to prevent crashes from null references

4. **Enhanced ProcessEncounterInternal**:
   - Added try-catch block to handle exceptions
   - Added explicit null check for the encounter parameter
   - Added reference storage for debugging purposes
   - Improved safety cleanup to maintain game stability

### CredentialChecker.cs

1. **Consistent Singleton Pattern Usage**:
   - Removed all direct `FindFirstObjectByType<MasterShipGenerator>()` calls
   - Always use `MasterShipGenerator.Instance` for references
   - Added error logging and recovery strategies when singleton is null

2. **Improved Event Subscription Management**:
   - Enhanced OnDestroy to properly unsubscribe from both local reference and singleton
   - Added try-catch block to prevent exceptions during cleanup
   - Improved diagnostic logging for subscription management

3. **Better Null Reference Protection**:
   - Added null checks before calling methods on shipGenerator
   - Implemented reconnection logic if shipGenerator is null
   - Added clear error messages to aid in troubleshooting

4. **Enhanced Decision Processing**:
   - Added safety checks when calling ProcessDecisionWithEncounter
   - Added recovery mechanism when shipGenerator reference is lost
   - Improved diagnostic information for debugging

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Improved Stability**:
   - The game will be less likely to crash due to null reference exceptions
   - Better error recovery mechanisms maintain gameplay flow

2. **Cleaner Architecture**:
   - Consistent usage of the singleton pattern throughout the codebase
   - Clear separation of responsibilities between components

3. **Better Diagnostics**:
   - Enhanced error logging with stack traces
   - DebugMonitor integration for tracking issues
   - Clear error messages for easier troubleshooting

4. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Code is more consistent and follows best practices
   - Better error handling makes future debugging easier
   - Reduced redundancy in error recovery code

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test various scenarios where ships are processed (approval, denial, etc.)
2. Test scene transitions to ensure singleton pattern works correctly
3. Test error recovery by temporarily forcing null references
4. Verify that event subscriptions are properly managed during gameplay
5. Check that DebugMonitor correctly tracks important diagnostic information
