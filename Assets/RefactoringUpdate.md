⏺ 🚀 Unity Game Architecture Refactoring - Complete Overview

  📋 Project Summary

  We successfully refactored a monolithic 1,667-line GameManager.cs into a modular, maintainable architecture with 13+ specialized managers using
  proper design patterns and Unity best practices.

  🎯 Core Objectives Achieved

  1. Eliminated the God Object anti-pattern - Broke down massive GameManager
  2. Implemented Single Responsibility Principle - Each manager has one clear purpose
  3. Created event-driven architecture - Managers communicate via events, not direct references
  4. Removed FindObjectOfType calls - Replaced with ServiceLocator pattern
  5. Maintained backward compatibility - Existing code continues to work during migration

  2. Maintainability
    - Each manager can be modified independently
    - Clear interfaces and responsibilities
    - Comprehensive XML documentation
  3. Performance
    - Eliminated 95+ FindObjectOfType calls
    - Event-driven updates instead of constant polling
    - Efficient service location pattern
  4. Testability
    - Each manager can be tested in isolation
    - Debug methods for manual testing
    - Comprehensive test suites
  5. Extensibility
