  possibleStories:
  - Medical supplies for the research wing. Experimental treatments for... various
    conditions. All properly sealed, of course.
  - Pharmaceutical research materials. The lab specifically requested these compounds
    for their latest breakthrough project.
  - Therapeutic compounds for the medical bay. Still in trials, but showing promising
    results for enhanced... human performance.
  - Biomedical specimens for genetic research. Cutting-edge work on cellular regeneration
    and metabolic enhancement.
  possibleManifests:
  - Medical Supplies, Research Compounds, Experimental Serums (Bio-hazard Level 2)
  - Pharmaceutical Materials, Gene Therapy Agents, Enhancement Formulas (Clinical
    Trial)
  - Laboratory Specimens, Cellular Modifiers, Metabolic Accelerators (Unstable)
  - Therapeutic Compounds, Genetic Catalysts, Biological Enhancers (Prototype Stage)

  possibleConsequences:
  - Serum exposure causes rapid hair growth. Half the base crew develops uncontrollable
    beards within hours.
  - Biological agent triggers hibernation response. Affected personnel fall into
    deep sleep, disrupting all operations.
  - Experimental compound creates zombie-like symptoms. Infected staff shamble around
    mumbling about 'brains' and rations.
  - Gene therapy goes wrong, causing personnel to communicate only in grunts and
    primitive gestures.
