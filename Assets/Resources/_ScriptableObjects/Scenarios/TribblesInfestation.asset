    morale purposes. Completely safe.
  - Small mammals for the agricultural research division. They're studying their...
    reproductive efficiency for food production.

  possibleConsequences:
  - Tribbles multiply exponentially. Within hours, thousands flood the ventilation
    systems causing complete base lockdown.
  - Rapid reproduction overwhelms food supplies. Emergency rationing declared as
    tribbles consume everything organic.
  - Tribble infestation clogs critical systems. Life support compromised, requiring
    costly emergency maintenance.
  - Exponential breeding creates avalanche effect. Officers trapped in quarters by
    walls of purring creatures.
