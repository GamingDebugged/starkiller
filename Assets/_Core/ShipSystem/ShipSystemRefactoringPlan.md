# Ship System Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for migrating and refactoring the ship generation components in the Starkiller Base Command project to a more maintainable and organized architecture.

## Completed Steps
1. ✅ Created IShipGenerator interface defining the core methods of the ship generation system
2. ✅ Reorganized MasterShipGenerator.cs with proper documentation and code organization
3. ✅ Moved both files to the new `_Core/ShipSystem` folder

## Next Steps

### 1. Identify and Refactor Related Components
Identify other ship-related components that should be moved to the ShipSystem namespace:

- [ ] **MasterShipEncounter.cs** - Move to ShipSystem and refactor to follow coding standards
- [ ] **ShipType.cs** - Move to ShipSystem/Data
- [ ] **CaptainType.cs** - Move to ShipSystem/Data
- [ ] **ShipScenario.cs** - Move to ShipSystem/Data
- [ ] **ShipCategory.cs** - Move to ShipSystem/Data
- [ ] **ShipScenarioProvider.cs** - Move to ShipSystem/Providers
- [ ] **HoldingPatternProcessor.cs** - Move to ShipSystem/Processors
- [ ] **ShipTimingController.cs** - Move to ShipSystem/Controllers

### 2. Create Specialized Subclasses
Break down MasterShipGenerator into more focused classes that implement IShipGenerator:

- [ ] **StandardShipGenerator** - For generating regular, non-story ships
- [ ] **StoryShipGenerator** - Specialized in generating story-based encounters
- [ ] **TestShipGenerator** - For generating test/debug encounters

### 3. Create Factory and Manager Classes

- [ ] **ShipGeneratorFactory** - Responsible for creating appropriate IShipGenerator instances
- [ ] **ShipEncounterManager** - High-level manager that coordinates all ship-related activities

### 4. Update References and Ensure Compatibility

- [ ] Update scripts that reference the old classes to use the new hierarchy
- [ ] Create adapter classes if needed for legacy code compatibility
- [ ] Maintain singleton access for now, but via the interface where possible

### 5. Implement Dependency Injection

- [ ] Refactor components to use dependency injection instead of direct references
- [ ] Remove singleton pattern where appropriate
- [ ] Use event-based communication for loose coupling between systems

### 6. Add Tests

- [ ] Create test cases for core ship generation functionality
- [ ] Test encounter generation with different parameters
- [ ] Test the decision processing flow

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Preserve Existing Functionality**: Ensure all current features continue to work
2. **Use Namespaces**: All ship-related code should be in the `StarkillerBaseCommand.ShipSystem` namespace
3. **Progressive Integration**: Implement changes in small, testable increments
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear XML documentation on all public methods
5. **Code Organization**: Use regions and follow project code style guidelines
6. **Error Handling**: Maintain robust error handling with clear logging

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: More organized code with clearer responsibilities
- **Extensibility**: Easier to add new ship types or generation algorithms
- **Testability**: Better separation of concerns allows for more thorough testing
- **Readability**: Better organization makes the codebase easier to understand
- **Robustness**: More explicit error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Timeline Estimate

- Initial Refactoring (Steps 1-2): 2-3 days
- Advanced Refactoring (Steps 3-4): 3-4 days
- Testing and Optimization (Steps 5-6): 2-3 days

Total: 7-10 days of development work
