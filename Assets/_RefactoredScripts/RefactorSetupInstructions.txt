REFACTORED COMPONENTS SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

If Unity isn't seeing the new scripts, follow these steps:

STEP 1: Force Unity to Refresh
------------------------------
1. In Unity, go to Assets → Refresh (or Ctrl+R / Cmd+R)
2. OR delete the Library folder and let Unity regenerate it
3. OR restart Unity completely

STEP 2: Check File Locations
----------------------------
These files should exist:
✓ _RefactoredScripts/README.md
✓ _RefactoredScripts/Core/ServiceLocator.cs  
✓ _RefactoredScripts/Core/GameEvents.cs
✓ _RefactoredScripts/Core/Managers/GameStateManager.cs
✓ _RefactoredScripts/TestRefactoredComponents.cs

STEP 3: Add Components to Scene (IN ORDER)
------------------------------------------
1. Create Empty GameObject → Name: "ServiceLocator"
   → Add Component: ServiceLocator

2. Create Empty GameObject → Name: "GameStateManager" 
   → Add Component: GameStateManager

3. Create Empty GameObject → Name: "RefactorTester"
   → Add Component: TestRefactoredComponents

STEP 4: Test
------------
1. Hit Play
2. Check Console for:
   "[ServiceLocator] Initialized and registered"
   "[GameStateManager] State changed: MainMenu -> MainMenu"
   "✅ ServiceLocator working correctly"

STEP 5: If Still Having Issues
------------------------------
- Check that all .cs files have using statements at the top
- Make sure no compile errors (red icons in Console)
- Try renaming GameStateManager to something else temporarily
- Check that you're not missing any dependencies

STEP 6: Alternative Simple Test
-------------------------------
If the above doesn't work, try creating a simple test script:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class SimpleTest : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("Simple test working!");
    }
}
```

If this doesn't work either, there's a Unity project issue.
If it does work, the problem is with our namespace/dependencies.
