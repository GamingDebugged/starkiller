- Add features to existing scripts
- Generate boilerplate code for common Unity patterns

#### Example Prompts:
```bash
claude "create a comprehensive inventory management system script"
claude "add input validation to our character movement script"
claude "implement a save/load system for game progress"
```

### 4. Unity-Specific Workflow Assistance
- Scene hierarchy analysis
- Prefab management strategies
- Project structure optimization

#### Example Prompts:
```bash
claude "review our current scene hierarchy and suggest improvements"
claude "create a strategy for managing reusable game objects as prefabs"
claude "optimize our project folder structure for better organization"
```

### 5. Testing and Debugging
- Unit test generation
- Debugging assistance
- Performance analysis

#### Example Prompts:
```bash
claude "create unit tests for our core game mechanics"
claude "help diagnose this null reference exception"
claude "analyze potential performance bottlenecks in our scripts"
```

### 6. Version Control and Documentation
- Git operations
- Commit management
- Project documentation generation

#### Example Prompts:
```bash
claude "create a comprehensive README for our Unity project"
claude "generate a commit message summarizing recent changes"
claude "create developer documentation for our game's core systems"
```

## Best Practices for Using Claude Code in Unity Development

### Installation Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- Git 2.23+
- Active Anthropic Console account

### Workflow Tips
1. Always work in your project's root directory
2. Break complex tasks into focused interactions
3. Use specific, clear commands
4. Leverage the `/compact` command for long conversations
5. Utilize `/clear` to reset context between major tasks

## Limitations and Considerations
- Research preview version
- Requires active billing account
- Not a replacement for comprehensive testing
- Always review and validate generated code

## Cost Management
- Average cost: ~$6 per developer per day
- Use `/cost` to track token usage
- Break down complex tasks to minimize token consumption

## Complementing Claude App
When Claude App hits context or complexity limits, use Claude Code for:
- Comprehensive script rewrites
- Large-scale project restructuring
- Detailed code analysis
- Batch file modifications

## Example Full Workflow
```bash
# Navigate to Unity project
cd MyUnityGame

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Get project overview
> explain the overall structure of our Unity game

# Refactor a specific system
> optimize our enemy AI implementation

# Generate documentation
> create a README.md detailing our game's core systems
```

## Quick Reference Commands
- `claude`: Start interactive session
- `/help`: Show available commands
- `/init`: Initialize project guide
- `/clear`: Reset conversation context
- `/cost`: Check token usage
- `/compact`: Compress conversation history

## Contact and Support
- Report bugs: `/bug` command
- GitHub repository for feedback
- Anthropic Console for account management

## Resolving Claude App Connection and Context Issues

### Common Connection and Context Limitations

#### 1. Context Window Restrictions
- Claude App has a maximum context window (typically around 200,000 tokens)
- Large Unity projects can quickly exceed this limit
- Symptoms include:
  - Truncated responses
  - Inability to process entire project structure
  - Loss of conversation context

#### 2. Connectivity Troubleshooting Strategies

##### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Use Claude Code to diagnose connection-related issues
claude "analyze current project connectivity constraints"
claude "help me manage large project context efficiently"
```

##### Context Management Techniques
1. Breaking Down Large Tasks
```bash
# Instead of processing entire project at once
claude "summarize core gameplay systems"
claude "focus on player movement mechanics"
claude "detail enemy AI implementation"
```

2. Modular Documentation Approach
- Create separate markdown files for different project aspects
- Use Claude Code to generate and manage these files
```bash
claude "create project_architecture.md"
claude "generate gameplay_systems.md"
claude "document networking_approach.md"
```

3. Token-Efficient Exploration
```bash
# Targeted exploration instead of comprehensive analysis
claude "list all C# scripts in the project"
claude "summarize purpose of each major script"
claude "identify potential performance bottlenecks"
```

#### 3. Advanced Context Management

##### File-Based Workflow
1. Export relevant scripts to individual files
2. Use Claude Code to process files in chunks
```bash
# Process scripts individually
claude "analyze PlayerController.cs in detail"
claude "optimize EnemyAI.cs for performance"
claude "review NetworkManager.cs for best practices"
```

##### Version Control Integration
- Use git to manage context and script versions
```bash
claude "create git-based workflow for managing large projects"
claude "help me implement modular script architecture"
```

#### 4. When to Switch Between Claude App and Claude Code

| Scenario | Recommended Tool | Rationale |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Quick code questions | Claude App | Immediate, lightweight interaction |
| Comprehensive script analysis | Claude Code | Deeper, more structured exploration |
| Large-scale refactoring | Claude Code | Better context management |
| Specific Unity workflow | Claude Code | Terminal-based, project-aware |
| Architectural overview | Claude App | Concise summary |
| Performance optimization | Claude Code | Detailed, systematic approach |

### Recommended Workflow
1. Use Claude App for initial brainstorming
2. Switch to Claude Code for detailed implementation
3. Leverage both tools complementarily

## Final Thoughts
Claude Code and Claude App are complementary tools that, when used strategically, can significantly enhance your Unity game development workflow. Understanding their strengths and limitations is key to maximizing their potential.
