# Developer Notes and Thought Process

## Initial Analysis

When first examining the "Starkiller Base Command" concept, I identified it as a document-checking game similar to "Papers, Please" but with a Star Wars theme. The core mechanic involves validating credentials and making approve/deny decisions.

### Key Design Considerations

1. **Scope Management**
   - The game needs to be completable in 12 hours (weekend project)
   - Must have a complete gameplay loop
   - Should be expandable after initial implementation
   - Focus on core mechanics first, polish later

2. **Technical Architecture**
   - UI-driven gameplay suits 2D implementation
   - Modular components make collaboration easier
   - Separate data generation from presentation
   - Create extensible systems for future expansion

3. **User Experience Priorities**
   - Clear presentation of information
   - Immediate feedback on decisions
   - Straightforward controls
   - Thematically consistent interface

## Script Design Decisions

### GameManager.cs
I designed the GameManager to be the central controller of game state, responsible for:
- Managing the overall game flow
- Tracking player performance (strikes, score)
- Interfacing between other components
- Controlling round progression

This separation ensures that game logic is isolated from presentation, making it easier to modify gameplay without affecting UI.

### ShipEncounterSystem.cs
This system generates varied ship encounters based on configurable data. I chose to:
- Use scriptable objects/inspector-configurable arrays for easy data entry
- Implement weighted randomization for varied scenarios
- Create both valid and invalid credential combinations
- Ensure each invalid ship has a clear reason for rejection

This approach allows for rich content creation without code modifications.

### CredentialChecker.cs
For the UI interaction component, I focused on:
- Clear presentation of ship data
- Interactive reference materials (log book)
- Visual feedback on decisions
- Simple, clear controls

This creates an intuitive interface while separating UI logic from game logic.

### UIManager.cs
For managing navigation between different game states, I created a dedicated manager that:
- Controls panel visibility
- Handles transitions between game states
- Manages audio feedback for UI interactions
- Provides centralized UI control

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Minimum Viable Product**
   - Basic credential checking with approve/deny
   - Simple ship generation with valid/invalid credentials
   - Core game loop with success/failure states
   - Minimal UI to display necessary information

2. **Incremental Features**
   - Enhanced ship variety
   - Visual improvements
   - Audio feedback
   - Additional credential types
   - Narrative elements

3. **Polish Phase**
   - Balancing difficulty
   - Adding Star Wars aesthetic
   - Improving feedback clarity
   - Optimizing user experience

## Technical Considerations

### For 2D Implementation
- Focus on UI Canvas elements
- Use TextMeshPro for text rendering
- Possibly implement simple animations for transitions
- Consider parallax effects for visual depth

### Performance Optimization
- Batch UI updates to minimize draw calls
- Pool ship encounters for memory efficiency
- Preload audio assets to avoid runtime hitches
- Use object pooling for frequent UI elements

### Extensibility
- Design data structures to allow for easy content addition
- Create interfaces for potential new features
- Document connection points for expansion
- Use events for loose coupling between components

## Collaboration Notes

Working with an art-focused collaborator means:
- Creating clear attachment points for visual assets
- Documenting UI element requirements
- Providing visual debug options
- Setting up placeholder art that's easy to replace
- Making component references drag-and-drop in Unity inspector

## Future Enhancement Ideas

With the modular design, these expansions would be straightforward:
1. **Ship Scanning** - Add additional credential verification step
2. **Tiered Difficulty** - Progressively complex credential checking
3. **Narrative Events** - Special scenarios with story impact
4. **Reputation System** - Track standing with different factions
5. **Economy System** - Earn rewards for correct decisions

## Technical Debt Considerations

Areas to revisit if time permits:
1. Improve error handling with more descriptive messages
2. Enhance component serialization for editor usability
3. Add more extensive documentation
4. Create editor custom inspectors for data entry
5. Implement automated tests for core logic
