- Architectural insights for complex Unity projects

#### Example Prompts:
```bash
claude "explain the overall architecture of our Unity game"
claude "document the purpose of each script in our project"
claude "create a high-level overview of our game's core systems"
```

### 2. Script Optimization and Refactoring
- Performance improvement suggestions
- Code quality enhancement
- Architectural best practices for Unity scripts

#### Example Prompts:
```bash
claude "optimize performance of our PlayerController script"
claude "refactor our enemy AI to improve efficiency"
claude "identify and fix potential memory leaks in our scripts"
```

### 3. Script Generation and Modification
- Create new C# scripts from scratch
- Add features to existing scripts
- Generate boilerplate code for common Unity patterns

#### Example Prompts:
```bash

claude "add input validation to our character movement script"
claude "implement a save/load system for game progress"
```

### 4. Unity-Specific Workflow Assistance
- Scene hierarchy analysis
- Prefab management strategies
- Project structure optimization

#### Example Prompts:
```bash
claude "review our current scene hierarchy and suggest improvements"
claude "create a strategy for managing reusable game objects as prefabs"
claude "optimize our project folder structure for better organization"
```

### 5. Testing and Debugging
- Unit test generation
- Debugging assistance
- Performance analysis

#### Example Prompts:
```bash
claude "create unit tests for our core game mechanics"
claude "help diagnose this null reference exception"
claude "analyze potential performance bottlenecks in our scripts"
```

### 6. Version Control and Documentation
- Git operations
- Commit management
- Project documentation generation

#### Example Prompts:
```bash
claude "create a comprehensive README for our Unity project"
claude "generate a commit message summarizing recent changes"

```

## Best Practices for Using Claude Code in Unity Development

### Installation Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- Git 2.23+
- Active Anthropic Console account

### Workflow Tips
1. Always work in your project's root directory
2. Break complex tasks into focused interactions
3. Use specific, clear commands
4. Leverage the `/compact` command for long conversations
5. Utilize `/clear` to reset context between major tasks

## Limitations and Considerations
- Research preview version
- Requires active billing account
- Not a replacement for comprehensive testing
- Always review and validate generated code

## Cost Management
- Average cost: ~$6 per developer per day
- Use `/cost` to track token usage
- Break down complex tasks to minimize token consumption

## Complementing Claude App
When Claude App hits context or complexity limits, use Claude Code for:
- Comprehensive script rewrites
- Large-scale project restructuring
- Detailed code analysis
- Batch file modifications

## Example Full Workflow
```bash
# Navigate to Unity project
cd MyUnityGame

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Get project overview
> explain the overall structure of our Unity game

# Refactor a specific system
> optimize our enemy AI implementation

# Generate documentation
> create a README.md detailing our game's core systems
```

## Quick Reference Commands
- `claude`: Start interactive session
- `/help`: Show available commands
- `/init`: Initialize project guide
- `/clear`: Reset conversation context
- `/cost`: Check token usage
- `/compact`: Compress conversation history

## Contact and Support
- Report bugs: `/bug` command
- GitHub repository for feedback
- Anthropic Console for account management

## Final Thoughts
Claude Code is a powerful assistant that can significantly enhance your Unity game development workflow when used strategically and thoughtfully.
