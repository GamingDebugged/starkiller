## **üéÆ PLAYER PSYCHOLOGY**

### **Emotional Pressure Points**

1. **Investment:** Players care more about named family than abstract citizens  
2. **Guilt:** Every choice disappoints someone you love  
3. **Escalation:** Problems compound rather than resolve  
4. **Revelation:** Understanding everyone's motivations makes choices harder  
5. **Consequences:** Seeing family messages after betrayal creates regret

### **No Perfect Path**

* Saving everyone requires moral compromise  
* Imperial loyalty costs family lives  
* Rebel sympathy risks everyone  
* Neutrality satisfies no one  
* Every ending is bittersweet

---

## **üìù IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **For Developers**

1. Family messages should feel personal and emotional  
2. Consequences should clearly link to earlier decisions  
3. Each family member needs distinct voice/personality  
4. Escalation should feel natural, not forced  
5. Point of No Return must feel climactic

### **For Writers**

1. Use family nicknames/pet names for intimacy  
2. Reference shared history/memories  
3. Show personality through message style  
4. Build tension through subtext  
5. Make player feel the weight of betrayal

### **For Designers**

1. Balance credit costs to force hard choices  
2. Ensure multiple viable paths to each ending  
3. Make family deaths meaningful, not random  
4. Create memorable decision moments  
5. Reward both loyalty and rebellion equally
